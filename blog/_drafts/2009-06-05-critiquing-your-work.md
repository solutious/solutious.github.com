Critiquing your work is a difficult and unpleasant business. 

It can even devolve into a habit of self-deprecation. You've seen better designs before. You're code is sloppy and unorganized. You clearly didn't do enough research for that blog post. 

[Paul Newman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman) (of salad dressing fame) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silver_Chalice_(film)#Newman.27s_view_on_the_movie" title="The Silver Chalice">took out an ad</a> to apologize for his performance in The Silver Chalice. 

Intuitively we know that there's more to getting stuff done than being skilled in a single domain. For example


I imagine that many, many projects are abandoned based on the notion that they will never match up. 


* Fernando Miyata - Brazilian guitarist. Stands out, has his own site. But there many many more. 
    * http://www.fernandomiyata.com/
    * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATub40Npxik (live: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7yh5-y5aDA)

## What is talent? ##

When people say someone is talented, they must be referring to skill. No one would think that Fernando Miyata just picked up a guitar and started cranking out those licks. That kind of playing takes thousands of hours of *attentive practice*. Malcolm Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours and others says it's [more] or it's [less] or that it's a [stupid] thing to say. I don't know if 10,000 hours is correct or whether it's even possible to distill all human endeavor down to a single amount of requisite practice, but I do know that's it absolutely not 0 hours or even 100 hours. Given that attentive practice is no swiss picnic, it would be more accurate to describe talent as 



Talent is hard work. 


This is what matters:

* It makes sense to you
* You're enjoying your time
