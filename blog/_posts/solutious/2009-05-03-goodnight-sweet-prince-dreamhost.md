I had a difficult time putting to words the excitement I felt when GitHub announced [CNAME support](http://github.com/blog/315-cname-support-for-github-pages). And now, just a few short months later I've finally freed myself from Dreamhost's shackles. I'm now using GitHub for all my hosting needs (including solutious.com) and I must say, it feels pretty good.

Shared hosting has served a useful purpose over the years, but it's days are numbered. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/pricing): free. [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/): free. [AppJet](http://appjet.com/): free. You can't argue with that. GitHub is not free but CNAME support is included with all paid accounts which I already have. I'm now riding the workflow of the future!

## Workflow of the Future

    Me -> TextMate -> Markdown -> Terminal -> Jekyll -> Git -> You
