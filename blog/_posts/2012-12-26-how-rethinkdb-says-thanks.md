I posted a couple weeks ago about [my experience installing RethinkDB](/blog/2012/11/12/installing-rethinkdb-ubuntu/). Today I got this in the mail:

![Thank you RethinkDB](/blog/assets/2012/rethink-thankyou.jpg "Who doesn't love getting mail?")

That's a moleskin and a usb key (with a metal case). The handwritten note is fine touch too.

Thank you [@al3xandru](https://twitter.com/al3xandru) and [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/).
