I used to joke with my team at [YellowPages](http://www.yellowpages.ca/), "if you can't be great, be just good enough". It kept being a joke until I realized it's a reasonable approach to starting a company. Starting a company is a lot of work. By definition, there's too much to do and too few people to do it. And not just because of the the long hours: it's the variety of tasks. There's a lot to do outside of your areas of expertise. 

For the technically inclined, this can mean spending time sales and administration. For the business folks, it can mean learning about version control and capacity planning. That's just the most obvious stuff; there are many shades of grey in between (a programmer isn't necessarily a sysadmin, etc). There's a very real risk of feeling overwhelmed and under qualified. So what are your options:

* **Work yourself to exhaustion.** This obviously is not sustainable. It doesn't necessarily increase the quality of your output either. 
* **Focus your attention on a few key areas.** This is probably not possible unless you have a very straightforward business. There's  also the risk of working yourself to local maxima (very common amongst amateur body builders). 
* **Redefine what it means to be "done".**
