  hook: Define Rack-apps in plain-text
  link: http://github.com/delano/otto/
  desc: "Apps build with Otto have three, basic parts: a rackup file, a ruby file, and a routes file. If you've built a Rack app before, then you've seen a rackup file before. The ruby file is your actual app and the routes file is what Otto uses to map URI paths to a Ruby method."
- name: Rye 0.9

  hook: Git-like hashes and history for Ruby objects

- name: Bone 0.3
  hook: Remote environment variables
  link: http://github.com/solutious/bone/
  desc: Bone is a command-line tool and Ruby library that acts just like environment variables. However, because the values are stored remotely, they can be accessed from any machine, anywhere.

  hook: Basic, platform-specific, system information
  link: http://github.com/delano/sysinfo/
  desc: "SysInfo takes a very quick glance at the system it's running on and exposes the results as YAML, JSON, CSV, or TSV. It also determines a platform identifier for the system that takes the form: VM-OS-IMPLEMENTATION-ARCHITECTURE (e.g. ruby-unix-osx-x86_64)."
