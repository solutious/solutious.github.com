title: What GitHub Punch Cards Say

I'm fascinated with GitHub's [punch](http://github.com/solutious/stella/graphs/punch_card) [cards](http://github.com/mislav/hanna/graphs/punch_card). 

They answer obvious questions like, what hours of the day are you most productive? And do you work weekends? But over the lifetime of a project, the punch cards gives you a glimpse in your work lifestyle. 



* Punch cards show dedication. 
* Look at commits first. Make sure it's one person. 
* Marc-Andre Cournoyer appears to work a regular schedule. The bulk of the work is after working hours. Smaller changes during the day (maybe bug fixes/minor tweaks while using thin).
