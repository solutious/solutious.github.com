I started this blog in September 2008 with a post about [encryption in Ruby](/2008/09/16/simple-ruby-encryption.html). I used [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) because I wanted something quick and simple. As it turned out, Tumblr is a great service for personal blogs but not for group and company blogs. Adding multiple users to a single blog with Tumblr is *strange*. Every user must have their own personal blog before they can be added to the group blog. I also wanted more control over the layout and content. 

In December [I switched to WordPress](/2008/12/12/tumblr-to-wordpress.html). It was a surprisingly pleasant experience. I could do almost everything I wanted to do with the layout and I brought the content home to our own servers. But something still did not feel right. I don't particularly like databases at the best of times and using one for a blog is more than a bit excessive. There's a lot of overhead involved in running a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog (the same thing can be said about any blog engine that combines an application with a database). There's the system administration to keep it up to date, secure, and performing well. There are more steps than necessary to write new posts. It's slow. That's a lot of cake!

So what's the solution? [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a blog-aware, static site generator. What's old is new again. I've been using Jekyll for [solutious.com](http://solutious.com) for about a month and I'm loving it. Unlike databases, I love files regardless of the times so using a static site is right up my alley. And now I'm using it for the blog too. There's a lot [of positive](http://www.oiledmachine.com/posts/2008/12/27/overview-of-jekyll--a-static-site-generator-written-in-ruby.html) [and helpful](http://blog.favrik.com/2009/03/02/installing-jekyll-on-ubuntu-8-10/) [stuff written](http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/12/21/migrating-project-websites-to-github-pages-with-sake-tasks-new-websites-with-jekyll_generator/) [about it](http://metajack.im/2009/01/23/blogging-with-git-emacs-and-jekyll/) already so I won't re-iterate that here. But I will mention that Jekyll also [plays nice with GitHub](http://github.com/blog/402-github-pages-upgraded-to-jekyll-0-5-0) (which is logical since it's written by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/)). 

I'll also mention that I like the name. Thanks TPW!
