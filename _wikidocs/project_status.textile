h2. Current Release: Rudy v0.7 - BETA

_Rudy is currently under active development to bring it up to a 1.0 release._

h3. Beta Notice

I've put a lot of effort into making Rudy safe and practical for early adopters. In fact, Rudy has been in production use in a private beta for over 2 months. That said, there are a few reasons why you want to exercise caution:

# *Unexpected error messages*. It's a new project so it hasn't had the exposure to the real world like Capistrano or Chef or Puppet. There are inevitably going to be scenarios I didn't plan for. 
# *Rudy commands and APIs may change* in later releases. This means that if you create an environment with an alpha release and later upgrade Rudy, some things may not work as expected.
