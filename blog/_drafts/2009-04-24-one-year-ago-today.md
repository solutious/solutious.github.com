One year ago today was the day I quit my job to work on Solutious full-time. I realized this fact only a few days ago. "Holy crap", I thought, "Time flies". I began to feel like someone's uncle. In any case, I decided to take this opportunity to reflect on how I've put the past year to use. 

I had been working for [Amdocs](http://amdocs.com/) for about six months. I started working for them in late 2007 after they acquired the company I worked for. That company was a search engine startup based in Boston. I started working with them in 2006 and it was a great gig. It was the most exciting and stressful time of my life. I learned a lot about business and life and I got to see new parts of the world. Looking back now, I'm surprised by how much time I spent in cabs. That experience is how I came to realize that I wanted to build a company of my own. 

So April 24 (2008) I left the salaried position. Saying goodbye to the team was tough, but only until the drinks started flowing. Then it was delicious. I wanted to keep my expenses down so I made a few other changes too. Most notably I moved out of my loft in Montreal. If I was concerned whether leaving a salaried position was the right decision work-wise then I was definitely concerned whether leaving that loft was the right decision life-wise. That place was home to many a caesar party`[1]`. And this was the context in which I started Solutious. Unemployed, homeless, and without caesars. 

The first thing I did was take a couple months to relax and catch up with friends and family. I ate squid on the fjords of Kotor and found a large S in the byways of Granada. Those had been on my TODO list for a while. This really helped me recharge after the 2 years with the search company. 

Then I spent a few months figuring out where Solutious and I were going. I already had the general direction, performance testing, but there was still a lot left to figure out. I didn't know what to expect during this period, other than it was probably going to be a non-linear process. And it was. I read a tonne, made more notes than I could shake a stick at, and wrote a few exploratory prototypes. Outwardly, this process must appear to . bt it's a defining time. You're deciding what symbols are going to be in your universe. 

Starting in September 2008.

I had no shortage of ideas kicking around, but I was pretty sure I wanted to work in the area of performance testing. 

My technology career  started by reading as much as I could about business and technology. 


## Notes

* `[1]` The caesar is Canada's version of the bloody mary (cocktail) which replaces tomato juice with clamato. There are many variations including my mine which calls for horseradish, crab meat, and a pickled, spicy green bean.
