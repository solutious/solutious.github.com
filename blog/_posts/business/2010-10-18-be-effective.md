title: Be 70% Effective

I used to joke with my team at [YellowPages](http://www.yellowpages.ca/), "if you can't make it great, make it just good enough". It kept being a joke until I started my own company. I realized that it's a reasonable approach to running a startup. 

Starting a company is very different from working in a larger organization. When you have a specific role, you can focus all of your attention on a limited set of tasks \[1\]. But in a startup, there's too much to do and too few people to do it. It's the amount of work and also the variety of tasks. There's a lot to do outside of your areas of expertise so it's easy to feel overwhelmed and under qualified. 

What didn't work:

* **Working myself to exhaustion.** This obviously was not sustainable and it took a crazy-long time to recover. It also didn't increase the quality of my output. 

* **Focusing on just a couple things.** I wrote some great code that I couldn't build a service around. It was fun and I became a better programmer but again, it wasn't sustainable.

* **Doing nothing.** It sounded like a great idea and I got some rest but it's obviously not a solution either. 

I'll be honest: I'm not [Bo Jackson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Jackson). I realized that if I was going to feel good about my work and motivated over the long haul I'd need to redefine what it meant to be done. 

## Just good enough (for now) ##

Every endeavour has an ideal outcome and the actual outcome. My mistake was comparing the actual outcome with the ideal one in my head and feeling bad that I wasn't living up to my own expectations. So I started evaluating my performance against 70% of the ideal -- not to legitimize mediocre work but to be more realistic. When you're working on many things, you need to take time from somewhere. You can always 

*So be 70% effective.* It's surprising how much you can accomplish by consistently achieving modest goals.

\[1\] Depending on the culture of the organization that can change. I call it "responsibility creep". It feels a lot like working at a startup without any of the benefits.
