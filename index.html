	<h2>About Solutious.</h2>
	<p>Solutious is a software testing company. We are building <span class="hilite">next-generation tools</span> to help businesses ensure their applications are ready to serve their customers on launch day. Established in 2006 as a technical consultancy, we helped clients build web applications, design and maintain production environments, and <span class="hilite">prepare application infrastructures for release readiness</span>. Now we're building our knowledge and experience into the testing tools we've always wanted. </p>

	<p>The old guard build complex products so they can charge for training and professional services. That way, you're locked in with proprietary formats and licensing agreements. We believe that <span class="hilite">B2B technology should reduce complexity</span> and open up access to data. It shouldn't require extensive training and gigantic manuals - it should provide value from Day One. Further, it shouldn't keep you from your data; it should <span class="hilite">create new ways to help you visualize and understand</span> it but also allow you access to the full, "raw" data set. We also believe that professional services shouldn't be a required part of the
process, but <a href="mailto:start@solutious.com" title="We can help">we're here</a> if you need us.</p>

<p><strong>We recently released a preview version of one of our projects, named Stella. It's a command-line tool for executing, investigating, and reporting on performance tests. You can check it out on <a href="http://github.com/solutious/stella/tree/master" title="Stella: Your friend in performance
testing on Github">Github</a> and <a href="https://rubyforge.org/projects/stella/" title="Stella: Your friend in performance
testing on Rubyforge">Rubyforge</a>.</strong></p>
