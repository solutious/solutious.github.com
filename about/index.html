		<img class="aboutPageDelano" src="/images/aboutPageDelano.png" alt="Delano Mandelbaum" align="left" border="0" />
    <p>I started this company in 2006 as a technical consultancy to help clients improve development processes, build production environments, and prepare for launch-day. I've worked hard for small companies like <a href="http://www.approximatch.com/" title="The ApproxiMatch search engine">ApproxiMatch</a> and <a href="http://status.net/" title="">Status.net</a> and large companies like <a href="http://amdocs.com/" title="Amdocs">Amdocs</a> and <a href="http://ypg.com/" title="YellowPages.ca">Yellow Pages Group</a>. I had a great time, met a lot of awesome people, and learned a ton.</p>

     <p>But there's a blight in the software industry that I'm determined to do something about: overly complex technology that wastes people's time. <em>Technology should reduce overall complexity</em>, yet I have found case after case where the opposite is true. Where's the love? </p>
     <p>So in 2008 I started focusing my attention on building great open source tools. I won't claim that our software is perfect, but it's built with care and attention down to even the smallest detail. I'm absolutely committed to ensuring it provides a net benefit to you and your projects. If you have any questions, problems, suggestions, or any other issue with any Solutious products, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
