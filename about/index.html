    <h2 class="sifr">About Solutious.</h2>
    
	  <p><em>Solutious is a software company based in Montr√©al.</em></p>
  
    <p>We believe in working hard and getting stuff done. </p>
  
    <h3 class="sifr">A Note From the Founder</h3>

  	<p> I started the company in 2006 as a technical consultancy to help clients establish development processes, build production environments, and prepare for launch-day. I've worked hard for companies large (<a href="http://amdocs.com/" title="Amdocs">Amdocs</a>, <a href="http://ypg.com/" title="YellowPages.ca">Yellow Pages Group</a>) and small (<a href="http://rilli.com/" title="">Rilli</a>, <a href="http://www.approximatch.com/" title="The ApproxiMatch search engine">ApproxiMatch</a>) and learned that all work is not created equal.</p>
  	
    <p>In 2008, I began focusing my attention on building great open source tools to help developers perform at their best. All of our software is available under the <a href="/license.txt" title="The Solutious License">MIT license</a> at <a href="http://github.com/solutious" title="Solutious at GitHub">GitHub</a>. If you have any questions, problems, other issues with any of our software, don't hesitate to contact me directly. I also accept success stories and party invitations!</p>
