	  <p>I&#8217;m fascinated with GitHub&#8217;s <a href='http://github.com/why/shoes/graphs/punch_card'>punch</a> <a href='http://github.com/mislav/hanna/graphs/punch_card'>cards</a>. They&#8217;re visual representations of project commits by day and hour and they&#8217;re available for every public project on GitHub. Here&#8217;s the punch card for <a href='http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/'>mislav-will_paginate</a>, one of the <a href='http://github.com/popular/watched'>most popular projects</a> on GitHub:</p>

<h3 id='will_paginate'>will_paginate</h3>
<a href='http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/graphs/punch_card'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3507637336_e1b9c97b20_o.png' border='0' height='150' width='400' /></a>
<p>The punch card says <a href='http://github.com/mislav/'>Mislav</a> works hard! He committed at all hours of the day, every day of the week (the larger the dot, the greater number of commits). It&#8217;s important to note, when looking at the punch cards, how many active developers have committed to the project. You could look through the <a href='http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/commits'>list of commits</a> but that&#8217;s tedious and verbose. The quickest way to gauge how many active developers there are on a project is to look at the <a href='http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/graphs/impact'>impact graph</a> (note that there are several committers for will_paginate, but the vast majority are from two accounts, both of which are Mislav).</p>

<h2 id='punch_cards_over_time'>Punch Cards Over Time</h2>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to see what a punch card looked like over time. I started saving them for a few of my own projects so I could animate them.</p>

<h3 id='rye_031_to_064'>Rye (0.3.1 to 0.6.4)</h3>

<p><a href='http://github.com/delano/rye'>Rye</a> is a small project that I started on April 4th for executing SSH commands from Ruby. I wrote the core of it over a couple of weekends and then iterated over the following few weeks. You can see that in the animation below.</p>
<a href='http://github.com/delano/rye/graphs/punch_card'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3605/3506751765_24443ccb39_o.gif' border='0' height='150' width='400' /></a>
<h3 id='rudy_040_to_073'>Rudy (0.4.0 to 0.7.3)</h3>

<p>I also saved them for a much larger project, <a href='http://github.com/solutious/rudy'>Rudy</a>. I started Rudy in February while doing some deployment work for <a href='http://rilli.com/'>Rilli</a>. The first frame is from version 0.4 and the second frame is version 0.5. They&#8217;re so different that it would be easy to assume I made a mistake generating the animation. That difference represents a month of hard work where I wrote and re-wrote the project several times.</p>
<a href='http://github.com/solutious/rudy/graphs/punch_card'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3359/3506751705_89f1fb5e38_o.gif' border='0' height='150' width='400' /></a><br />
<h2 id='in_conclusion'>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>What I love about the punch cards is that they&#8217;re both informative and motivational. They give me a better understanding of how I work and how my effort relates to that of other open source developers. When I&#8217;m focused on a goal like getting the next version out the door, I occasionally forget what I went through to get there. The punch cards help me remember.</p>

	  <p>If you&#8217;re like <a href='http://twitter.com/solutious'>me</a>, you woke up today thinking May 5th was Cinco de Mayo. What people like us didn&#8217;t know is that it&#8217;s also Louise Hendy Day. This is probably the first and last time you&#8217;ll hear about Louise Hendy Day, but the implications of it are pretty interesting.</p>
<p style='text-align: center'><a href='http://twitter.com/#search?q=louisehendyday' style='text-decoration: none;'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/3505434648_36eca44c11.jpg' border='0' /></a></p>
<h3 id='a_fictitious_holiday'>A Fictitious Holiday</h3>

<p>Louise Hendy Day is a fictitious holiday created by a <a href='https://twitter.com/louise_hendy'>single person</a>, earlier today, in an attempt to get into the trending topics on Twitter. And it worked. At least for a few hours (it&#8217;s no longer a trending topic as of 16:00 EST but the <a href='http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23louisehendyday'>flurry of messages continues</a>).</p>
<p style='text-align: center'><a href='http://tweetstats.com/trends' style='text-decoration: none;'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3357/3504801219_27d736ccf8.jpg' border='0' /></a></p>
<p>Why is this important? It&#8217;s important because we&#8217;ve heard a lot about the power of the web, &#8220;social media&#8221; in particular, to reach out to build and maintain networks of clients and customers. Rarely however, do we see this power in action, <em>in real time</em>. One person generated a massive buzz literally out of nothing. The product is a faux-celebration for a holiday that doesn&#8217;t otherwise exist.</p>

<h3 id='a_new_way_to_do_business'>A New Way to Do Business</h3>

<p>Now, there are two ways you can view Louise Hendy Day: a useless, passing fad or <em>a completely new way to do business</em>. You can communicate with current and prospective customers in real-time. It&#8217;s like having a conversation with thousands of people at the same time.</p>

<p>Twitter won&#8217;t do this alone &#8211; there will be other service providers &#8211; but already today, right now we have a tool more powerful than any PR agency ever had. That&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>

	  <p>I have a difficult time putting to words the excitement I felt when GitHub announced <a href='http://github.com/blog/315-cname-support-for-github-pages'>CNAME support</a>. And now, just a few short months later I&#8217;ve finally freed myself from Dreamhost&#8217;s shackles. I&#8217;m now using GitHub for all my hosting needs (including solutious.com) and I must say, it feels pretty good.</p>

<p>Shared hosting has served a useful purpose over the years, but it&#8217;s days are numbered. <a href='http://heroku.com/pricing'>Heroku</a>: free. <a href='http://code.google.com/appengine/'>Google App Engine</a>: free. <a href='http://appjet.com/'>AppJet</a>: free. You can&#8217;t argue with that. GitHub is not free but CNAME support is included with all paid accounts which I already have. I&#8217;m now riding the workflow of the future!</p>
