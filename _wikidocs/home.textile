h2. About Rudy

Rudy is a command-line tool for developing and deploying with Amazon EC2.

h3. Machines 

It organizes EC2 instances into groups of _environments_ and _roles_. These are called _machine_ _groups_.  You can run multiple machines with the same role. These are called _positions_. Rudy also supports running machine groups across availability _zones_. Rudy assumes some default values to make the initial installation easier. <tt>stage</tt> is the default environment and <tt>app</tt> is the default role (these can be changed). 

When you put all this together, you have a unique name for every machine. The default machine is:

<pre><code>             zone     env  role
              v        v    v   
        m-us-east-1b-stage-app-01
        ^                       ^
     "machine"                position</pre></code>

     
h3. Routines

Rudy breaks down the maintenance of EC2 instances into a set of routines. There are currently two routines available: <tt>startup</tt> and <tt>shutdown</tt>.

This is how you call a routine:

<pre><code>  $ rudy startup</pre></code>

And this is the output:
<pre><code>  Starting m-us-east-1b-stage-app-01
