The new version of [Solutious.com](http://solutious.com/) went live this week thanks to a lot of great work from designers [Adam Bognar](http://www.adambognar.com/) and [Andrew Simpson](http://andrewsimpsondesign.com/). I'm really excited about how it turned out and I thought it would be interesting to take a look at how the site and brand has developed over the past 8 months. 

### Prehistory

When I started the company in 2006, I put up what I thought would be a temporary homepage. I had an ongoing contract with a great company so I didn't have a need to update the site. Looking back, I probably had too many eggs in that one basket. It worked out fine, but the prudent choice would have been to spend a little time on business development regardless of the circumstances. In any case, the only information on the site for 2 years was the name of the company and a phone number.

### October 2008

In 2008 I decided to shift the focus of the company from providing services to bootstrapping a product (more about that in a future post). I absolutely needed a website at this point and after a few months of intense research and prototyping I came up with this: 

<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2466/3532525486_e41a1930e2_o.png"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2466/3532525486_dca088dbdd_m.jpg" border="0" /></a>

I was still heavy into product development so I had no content. There were no slogans and there was only a factual description of the company. There wasn't even a defined product yet! I needed to put *something* on the homepage so I threw in a motivational Samuel Johnson[1] quote: *"All industry must be excited by hope"*. I hadn't put much thought into it at the time, I simply thought it was interesting given the sombre tone of the economy, but as it turned out the spirit of that quote became the first kernel of the Solutious brand.

However, to say this design was an improvement over the stark yet earnest ASCII is a tough sell. It was more like a cry for help. It was clear to me that I required the services of a professional.


### January 2009

That professional came in the form of [Andrew Simpson](http://andrewsimpsondesign.com/). I had a

### On Brands

The terms "branding" and "brand development" have somewhat of a bad rap outside of design and business circles. Brands tend to be viewed as an interpretation, often a false one, of what a company or product actually is or does. That's a fair interpretation because there are a lot of dubious and misleading brands ([Fernandez](http://www.fernandes-softdrinks.com/), I'm talking to you). But it's not the only interpretation. It's also possible and highly advantageous to align a brand with reality.

And I expect we'll more 



\[1\] As a side note, I ran a tiny, underground [t-shirt](http://goldensword.ca/t-shirts/) business in 2006-2007. By "tiny" I'm referring to the fact that I had only one design and by "underground" I mean to say that the only sales channel was me wearing it and random strangers stopping me to ask about it. The shirt was a drawing of Louis Riel (Canada's preeminent historical rebel) but when I was in the United States I'd say it was Edgar Allen Poe. I had several other designs in the pipeline, including one of [Samuel Johnson](who wrote the first english dictionary by the way). It was going to be a drawing of him smiling while [reading the newspaper ](http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/J/JOH/samuel-johnson-reynolds.jpg) with text below that read, "Samuel L Johnson". If you're into t-shirts and you're in Montr√©al, I highly recommend [Blank](http://www.portezblank.com/).
