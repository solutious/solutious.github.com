	<h2 id="1_what_is_performance_testing">1. What is performance testing?</h2>

	<p>Performance testing is the process of discovering the operational characteristics of a system or application under a workload. Capability, capacity, stability, and speed are all considered. The core metrics are <span class="hilite">response times</span>, throughput and <span class="hilite">resource-utilization</span>, though other metrics, such as mean-time between failure, and operating and <span class="hilite">infrastructure costs</span>, can also be derived through performance testing. It explores several system qualities, simplified to:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Actual Speed</em></strong>: How quickly does the system respond under load?</li>
	<li><strong><em>Perceived Speed</em></strong>: Does the system meet the end user’s performance expectations?</li>
	<li><strong><em>Capacity</em></strong>: Is the infrastructure adequately sized?</li>
	<li><strong><em>Stability</em></strong>: Does the system behave correctly under load?</li>
	<li><strong><em>Scalability</em></strong>: <span class="hilite">Can the system grow to handle future volumes?</span></li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="2_what_are_the_types_of_performance_tests">2. What are the types of performance tests?</h2>

	<p>There are four families of performance tests:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Ad hoc tests</em></strong>: A quick, simple test run by developers to identify obvious performance issues such as infinite loops and memory leaks. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Stress tests</em></strong>: Pushes the application and/or infrastructure beyond specifications to see when and <span class="hilite"><em>how</em> it might fail</span>. Stress tests involve operating systems beyond their intended capacity. Common types of stress tests are:
	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Capacity test</em></strong>: Incrementally increases the number of concurrent users while monitoring the system resource load. The goal is to identify the number of concurrent connections at which the system performs at ideal capacity. <span class="hilite">Ideal capacity</span> is a business decision that generally ranges from 60% to 80% of total capacity.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Saturation test</em></strong>: A continuation of the capacity test. Discovers the point at which a resource has reached full utilization. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Spike test</em></strong>: Determines the performance characteristics of the system under test when subjected to rapid increases in workload for short periods of time.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Load tests</em></strong>: Places a certain load on a system to discover how the system performs over a long term. It’s ideal to use about 80% of the maximum load the system can handle. Common types of load tests are:
	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Benchmark test</em></strong>: <span class="hilite">Compares performance at <em>specific</em> points</span> in the project life cycle. A repeatable test, the most common use is comparing performance between nightly or weekly builds and between major releases before they are pushed to production. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Reliability</em></strong>: Determines how the system handles a <span class="hilite">realistic load over an extended period of time</span>, sometimes up to 30 days. The length of time is critical in catching the effects of background processes on operational performance. These processes include log rotation, database backup and replication. Reliability tests are also referred to as endurance tests.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Availability</em></strong>: Determines <span class="hilite">how quickly a system recovers from failure</span>. When a critical performance issue is identified by any of the other tests, availability testing can determine how much time it takes a system to return to normal operating conditions. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Scalability</em></strong>: Tests the ability of a system or application to handle additional workload while maintaining the expected performance levels. If <span class="hilite">a particular resource is increased</span> (ten front-ends instead of five, or 16GB of RAM rather than 8GB), how does this affect performance?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>UI/Rendering tests</em></strong>: Judges the speed and <span class="hilite">responsiveness of the client side</span> user interface. This is the perceived speed of the application from the end user’s perspective. These can also be considered functional tests, however the perceived performance of an application is critical to the success of any customer-facing project and must be considered as part of the overall performance. </li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="3_why_should_i_test_performance">3. Why should I test performance?</h2>

	<p><span class="hilite">Performance testing is about <em>assessing risk</em></span>. Your company probably wants to identify performance and operational issues before your customers do. Quantifying and forecasting these issues is determined through proper performance testing. Some common issues include:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Configuration issues</em></strong>: What is the ideal load-balancer configuration? <span class="hilite">How much memory</span> should be dedicated to caching? How often can the database be replicated without affecting response times?</li>
	<li><strong><em>Software issues</em></strong>: These include not only the code developed in house but also any open-source or vendor software dependencies. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Legal issues</em></strong>: Determine and <span class="hilite">meet your service level agreements</span> for partners and customers as required. Verify, as needed, that your vendors will meet their SLAs while your system is under load.  </li>
	<li><strong><em>Business criteria</em></strong>: Determine your business response to client usage. For example, if the system must support 500 simultaneous transactions with average response time under two seconds and no higher than five, <span class="hilite">will it succeed?</span>        </li>
	<li><strong><em>Forecasting infrastructure cost</em></strong>: Are you purchasing <span class="hilite"><em>too much</em> hardware?</span> <em>Too little</em>? When will you need to <em>increase</em> disk space?</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="4_when_should_performance_testing_be_included_in_the_project_life_cycle">4. When should performance testing be included in the project life cycle?</h2>

	<p>Performance testing is useful at all stages of the project life cycle. It's about risk assessment. <span class="hilite">The sooner issues are discovered, <em>the sooner they can be resolved</em>.</span> Issues can be found not just in the software, but in the overall infrastructure as well. The earlier in the process performance testing is incorporated, the greater the chance the project will finish on time and on budget. There are several reasons:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Nightly or weekly tests</em></strong>: Discover and correct problems during development  </li>
	<li><strong><em>Release candidate tests</em></strong>: Can provide data for production capacity planning</li>
	<li><strong><em>Pre-launch tests</em></strong>: Can identify hardware and network configuration issues before your customers do</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="5_what_tools_are_available_for_testing_the_performance_of_web_applications">5. What tools are available for testing the performance of web applications?</h2>

	<p>Traditionally, there are three types of tools available (outlined below).</p>

	<h3 id="vendor_tools">Vendor tools</h3>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong>:
	<ul>
	<li><span class="hilite">Generates <em>realistic</em> load scenarios</span></li>
	<li>Results can be shared and verified</li>
	<li>Training is available</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong>:
	<ul>
	<li>Expensive acquisition, maintenance, and training costs</li>
	<li>Acquisition can take weeks or months due to traditional sales cycles</li>
	<li>Proprietary scripting languages require training</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Examples</em></strong>: <a href="http://gomez.com/">Gomez</a>, <a href="https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&amp;cp=1-11-126-17^8_4000_100__">LoadRunner</a>, <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/products/silk/silkperformer/index.html">SilkPerformer</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/tester/performance/">Rational Performance Tester</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="open_source">Open Source</h3>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong>:
	<ul>
	<li>Supports most vendor features</li>
	<li><span class="hilite">Results and can be <em>shared</em> outside company</span></li>
	<li>Scripted in standard programming languages</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong>:
	<ul>
	<li>Limited reporting functionality</li>
	<li>Lack of support or training</li>
	<li>Poor or no graphical interface</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Examples</em></strong>: <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a>, <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">Grinder</a>, <a href="http://www.opensta.org/">OpenSTA</a>, <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a>, <a href="http://www.joedog.org/JoeDog/Siege">Siege</a>, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">Apache Bench</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="in_house">In House</h3>

	<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong>:
	<ul>
	<li>Experts exist in house</li>
	<li><span class="hilite">Tests can be performed <em>quickly</em></span></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong>:
	<ul>
	<li>In-house knowledge may not exist and can be lost when the expert(s) leave the company </li>
	<li>Validity of results questionable outside company (customers, partners, publications)</li>
	<li>Requires dedicated resources for the lifetime of the tool</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong><em>Examples</em></strong>: Usually one or more scripts written by the application developers</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="6_which_of_the_open_source_tools_is_the_best">6. Which of the open source tools is the best?</h2>

	<p>We like <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a> the best. It takes the most sensible approach to simulating complex workload scenarios. It doesn&#8217;t support having more than one load generating machine so for very large tests you&#8217;re better off with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a>. </p>

	<p>By the way, there are <em><a href="http://opensourcetesting.org/performance.php">many more</a></em> open source tools than what we list above (we stuck with the best ones).</p>

	<h2 id="7_do_you_provide_training_or_support">7. Do you provide training or support?</h2>

	<p>You bet. <span class="hilite">We provide a range of services</span> to help you assess your needs, create test plans, analyze your results, and debug performance problems. <a href="mailto:start@solutious.com" title="We can help">Contact us</a>. </p>
